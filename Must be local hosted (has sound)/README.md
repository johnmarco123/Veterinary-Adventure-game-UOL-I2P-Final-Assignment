Welcome to my game!

The game consists of five levels and has four difficulties.

peaceful - infinite lives (suggested if your testing/evaluating the games mechanics and levels)
Easy - 10 lives
Medium - 3 lives
Hard - 1 life

please note, there are two versions of the game. The only difference is one has sound, and one doesn't
I've found when testing that the sound can impact the games performance, therefore, i have decided to have a 
soundless version for gameplay and one for sound if your computer can handle it.
